# Stock Account App by Francisco Rosete
## This is a project for UCSB Full Stack Web Development Certificate 

- In this app you can search a stock symbol and see relevant intraday and historical info as well as headlines and links to full forecasts for a given stock symbol. 

- There is also an account section linked with alpaca.markets paper trading account. It manages the  portfolio of your trading simulations and you can see a series of details related to the performance of your portfolio in the market.

- There is also a watchlist page where you can track a given set of stock symbols as well as delete/manage the list. 

- There is a trading function as well were you can trade stocks based on a stock symbol and the quantity of shares you wish to buy. Trades are logged to a database and the results are reflected in the account view page. 
```
 Due to an error in the way the api is returning data, I had to disable the trading communication with the api Although the trades are still stored in the database and once the error is corrected I can activate the feature. I can also demonstrate that it does indeed execute the trade function in the api, but the return data causes an error although the trade is indeed logged and the results reflected in the account page. This was verified with the course Associate Advisor Masood.
